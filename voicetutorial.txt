The following software is required:

At the bottom are the "recording groups". Each group represents a type of thing that the bot should be able to say.

Each group should consist of multiple separate recordings. They may be different sentences, or even the same sentence said in a slightly different way. Each group is annotated with an example sentence.

Some recording groups require more individual recordings than others, as they are used more often. This is noted by the `1x` note next to the group, indicating the minimum amount of recordings that should be aimed for.

Refer to the video tutorial ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1cIUPdEdro ) for a demonstration on how to record all of the lines for the recording groups quickly.

The files must be saved in 22050hz in single-channel mono as .wav files. The individual recording file names are in the format of `ClientThrowingFlashbang_1.wav` etc.

You may freely use humour and NSFW speech, except for racism or extremely offensive speech.

Ask me for any questions.

Notes:
	- A small voice pack is about 200 files. A medium sized one is 300-400. A decently sized one is 500-600. 1000 is insane, but go ahead.
