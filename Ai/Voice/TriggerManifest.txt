Create each voice recording with the following file names:
- CannotDefuseBomb_1.wav
- CannotDefuseBomb_2.wav
- ClientThrowingSmoke_1.wav
- ClientThrowingSmoke_2.wav

Save the files as 22050hz .wav files. Place them in 1 folder.

Create between 20-40 recordings for each group. For recording groups that you know will be used more often (such as EnemyKilledByClient), make more recordings.

You can say the exact same words multiple times, with or without different tones or cadence.

The examples next to the recording group names are just examples. Say anything you like. Add some jokes or meme recordings. Say many different things.
